# TSN-Software-Development
Using this repository will be used primarily to showcase the code I have done during my skills bootcamp. Primary use of Python with it's libraries. Showcasing the more complex code we worked with.

Also had use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and will use this repo to see what other projects I can make and use as a portfolio for my work.
